# The paper title "Sympatho-adrenal cells reside systemically as a latent origin of neuroblastoma"

## Overview
We compared schwann cell precursors (SCPs) from wild-type and Sox10 heterozygous mice to investigate why the reduction of Sox10 gene dose enhances SCP-derived SA cell generation.

## Data
gz files are available in GEO, Accession number: GSE304632

## Requirements
R version: 4.2.0 (We have not verified whether running this code with a different version of R reproduces the same results as those reported in the paper.)

## Notes
In the code (e.g., saveRDS and readRDS), the "directory" indicates an arbitrary file path for saving or loading data; therefore, please modify it to your own desired directory.
